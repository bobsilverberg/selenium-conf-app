  	<h2>About the conference</h2>
    <p>The Selenium Conference brings together Selenium developers and
    enthusiasts from around the world to share ideas, socialize, and work
    together on advancing the present and future success of the project.</p>
  <p>The conference begins Monday with all-day workshops, followed by two days
    of talks. We’ll have a main track and a second informal track for other
    presentations. There will be pair-coding sessions throughout the day, as
    well as opportunities to get Selenium advice and tutorials from experts.
    We’re having a speaker dinner on Monday night and a welcome party on Tuesday
    night.</p>

  	<h2>About Selenium</h2>
    <p>Selenium is an open-source project for testing web-based applications in
    any web browser on any operating system on your desk or in your pocket.
    It’s awesome. You should use it.</p>
