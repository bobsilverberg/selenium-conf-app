Around 10 new ones are filed each day. Part of the joy of open source is: if you have problems, you have all the tools to fix them. All of the tools, yes, and tools are useful. But imagine going to Ikea, and just getting a big box of tools and parts. What’s missing? The assembly guide! You have no idea how things fit together. Sure, you can try to work it out, but why guess when you can be shown! As many of the Selenium committers as we can gather together will sit down with you, and help *you* fix a bug in Selenium.

Over the course of this workshop, we’ll take a tour of the codebase, look at the various moving parts and how they fit together, get comfy with the CrazyFun build grammar, and learn a little about the design philosophy of the project. Along the way, we’ll be writing some code, running some tests and hopefully having a little fun. You’ll walk away confident in making changes to the code, building Selenium from source, and ensuring that your changes don’t have any unexpected side effects! Participants must have a computer to use (or share) with Java 6 or later installed, a Java IDE of your choice (Eclipse and IntelliJ are both excellent possibilities) and the latest version of Firefox.

It has a clean and simple user interface for recording, playing back and editing scripts that allows you to seamlessly work with both versions of Selenium. Builder’s user interface is built on HTML and JQuery and is designed to be a lot cleaner and more streamlined compared to Selenium IDE. While not as fully featured as IDE (yet) it allows you to quickly record new scripts, edit steps, and try out scripts in-browser. Builder also currently supports exporting Selenium 2 tests to Java and Python and introduces a JSON-based format for storing tests to be opened and edited again later. Selenium Builder is still in beta, so your input and skill along with your suggestions are very much appreciated. Builder already supports Selenium extensions, and we want to develop a complete plugin system so that extra features such as Flash support can be added. We’re looking to find out from you: What would SB need to be integrated properly into the way you use Selenium right now? What would make you switch from Selenium IDE?

Five years later I find myself in the position of having used Selenium in a business context for almost half my career and nearly the entire lifetime of the tool. Selenium’s changed a lot, so have the Web sites it was designed to test, and so has the Web itself.

For the API, we exercise the same behaviors on the back-end via curl. All of these are driven by the same high-level, natural language specifications. One test, multiple implementations.
